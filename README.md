# summivox's Opinionated ESP32 C++ Boilerplate

This repo provides a clean yet convenient starting point for an ESP32 firmware project using C++20 with [ESP-IDF][].

A set of minimal examples are included to guide code organization, both for user code and for dependencies,
as well as showcasing some C++ tricks that simplify firmware writing. These can be removed easily to make room for your code.


## Usage

- Start a new repo based on this template repo, or just fork it.
- Clone your new repo using `git clone --recursive` (**make sure you use the `--recursive` flag!**)
- Download and setup [ESP-IDF][]. Recommended to use the [official VSCode plugin][ESP-IDF-vscode].
- Use [ESP-IDF][] to build and flash this project to an ESP32 development board.
- Read the examples in [`main/example/hello.cpp`](./main/example/hello.cpp) called from [`main/app_main.cpp`](./main/app_main.cpp).
- Check out [`sdkconfig.defaults`](./sdkconfig.defaults).

When you are ready to write your own code:

- Rename the project in the root [`CMakeLists.txt`](./CMakeLists.txt) .
- Remove the example module. Places you need to touch (note that the reverse is how you add new source/header pairs):
    - [`main/example`](./main/example)
    - main component's [`CMakeLists.txt`](./main/CMakeLists.txt) .
    - reference in [`main/app_main.cpp`](./main/app_main.cpp) .
- Remove unused components (you may need to properly remove git submodules using `git submodule deinit` and `git rm`).
- Choose your own licensing terms and replace the [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) file.
- Replace this [`README.md`](./README.md) file with your own ;)


## Features

- C++20 support (up to the GCC version supported by [ESP-IDF][]).
- Examples for external libraries / dependencies (see [components](./components)).
- Convenient utilities to reduce boilerplate (e.g. [FreeRTOS task wrapper](./main/common/task.hpp)).
